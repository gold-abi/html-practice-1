<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian Railways, operated by the Government of India under the Ministry of Railways, is one of the largest rail networks in the world and serves as the backbone of India’s transportation system. With a vast route length of over 68,000 kilometers and more than 7,300 operational stations, it facilitates the movement of millions of passengers and tons of freight daily. The network operates approximately 13,000 passenger trains and around 8,500 freight trains each day, with a total coach count exceeding 80,000. Over 85% of its broad gauge routes have been electrified, reflecting the system's commitment to energy efficiency and sustainability.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Indian Railways offers a wide range of train services catering to different segments of society. These include suburban trains in metropolitan areas like Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, long-distance express and superfast trains such as the Rajdhani and Shatabdi, and premium services like the Vande Bharat Express. There are also luxurious tourist trains such as the Palace on Wheels and Maharajas’ Express, as well as upcoming high-speed bullet trains, such as the Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor. For cargo movement, a strong fleet of freight trains and ongoing dedicated freight corridor projects ensure industrial and economic connectivity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Passenger amenities on Indian trains have significantly improved in recent years. Travelers can choose from various travel classes including unreserved, sleeper, and air-conditioned options. Facilities such as bio-toilets, charging ports, CCTV cameras in select trains, and onboard catering are becoming increasingly common. Stations are being upgraded with free Wi-Fi, digital signboards, and accessibility features such as ramps and wheelchairs for differently-abled passengers. Women and senior citizens are provided special quotas and reserved berths to enhance safety and comfort.</p>
